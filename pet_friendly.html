            <h2>Pet Friendly</h2>
            <p>We understand that pets are an important part of the family. <br>
                We are pet friendly by arrangement - so please talk to us about your needs. <br>
                We offer a fully enclosed backyard, shady trees, water bowls, food bowls and a lead if you forget one. <br>
                Only 3 minutes from a leash free beach, an oval close by and if you want to sleep in we are happy to take your dog (depending on its size) for a walk in the morning.<br>
